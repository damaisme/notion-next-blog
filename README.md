## üöÄ Menyiapkan Platform Anda

Ikuti langkah-langkah di bawah ini untuk men-deploy dan mengkonfigurasi platform blogging ini untuk penggunaan pribadi Anda.

### Prasyarat

* Node.js (v18.17 atau lebih baru)
* Akun Notion

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/damaisme/notion-next-blog.git](https://github.com/damaisme/notion-next-blog.git)
cd notion-next-blog
```
2. Install Dependencies
```Bash

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```
3. Set Up Notion
This is the most critical step to connect the platform to your content.

Duplicate the Notion Template: If you don't have one already, duplicate a blog database template into your Notion workspace.
Create a Notion Integration:
Go to the Notion integrations page.
Click "New integration," give it a name (e.g., "My Blog Platform"), and select the appropriate workspace.
Copy your "Internal Integration Token". This is your NOTION_API_KEY.
Get Your Database ID:
Open your Posts database in Notion.
Click the three-dot menu (...) > "Copy link to view".
From the link https://www.notion.so/YOUR_WORKSPACE/DATABASE_ID?v=..., copy your DATABASE_ID.
Connect the Integration to Your Database:
Go back to your database page in Notion, click the three-dot menu (...) > "Add connections" > then select the integration you just created.
4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the project root.

.env.local

NOTION_API_KEY="secret_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
NOTION_DATABASE_ID="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
Replace the placeholder values with your token and database ID.

5. Run the Development Server
Bash

npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your platform running with content from your Notion workspace.

‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration
Notion Property Names
Ensure the property names in the lib/notion.js file match the property names in your Notion database exactly (e.g., Status, Slug, Publish Date, Category).

Image Domains
To allow next/image to optimize images you upload to Notion, you need to add Notion's file hostname to your next.config.mjs.

next.config.mjs

JavaScript

const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 's3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com', // Hostname for Notion's files
      },
    ],
  },
};
ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ (Deployment)
This platform is designed to be easily deployed with Vercel.

Push your code to a GitHub repository.
Import your project on Vercel from the GitHub repository.
Add your Environment Variables (NOTION_API_KEY and NOTION_DATABASE_ID) in the Vercel project settings.
Deploy! Your site will be live.
