## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to deploy and configure this blogging platform for your personal use.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.17 or later)
* A Notion account
  
### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/damaisme/notion-next-blog.git](https://github.com/damaisme/notion-next-blog.git)
cd notion-next-blog
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```Bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```
### 3. Set Up Notion
This is the most critical step to connect the platform to your content.

- Duplicate the [Notion Template](https://futuristic-seagull-1eb.notion.site/Notion-Next-Blog-212872a4f66280299997e80a3b02d020?source=copy_link): If you don't have one already, duplicate a blog database template into your Notion workspace.
- Create a Notion Integration:
   - Go to the Notion integrations page.
   - Click "New integration," give it a name (e.g., "My Blog Platform"), and select the appropriate workspace.
   - Copy your "Internal Integration Token". This is your NOTION_API_KEY.
- Get Your Database ID (Settings, Author and Post Database):
   - Open your Posts database in Notion.
   - Click the three-dot menu (...) > "View Database".
   - From the link https://www.notion.so/YOUR_WORKSPACE/DATABASE_ID?v=..., copy your DATABASE_ID.
- Connect the Integration to Your Database:
   - Go back to your database page in Notion, click the three-dot menu (...) > "Add connections" > then select the integration you just created.

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the project root.
```
.env.local

NOTION_SECRET=secret_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTION_POST_DATABASE_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTION_SETTING_DATABASE_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTION_AUTHOR_DATABASE_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
REVALIDATE_SECRET=best-secret
```
Replace the placeholder values with your token and database ID.

### 5. Run the Development Server
```Bash

npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your platform running with content from your Notion workspace.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration
Notion Property Names
Ensure the property names in the lib/notion.js file match the property names in your Notion database exactly (e.g., Status, Slug, Publish Date, Category).

## üîÅ Manual Revalidation
This project supports manual content revalidation using a secure API endpoint. It's useful when you're using Notion as a headless CMS and want to instantly reflect content updates without waiting for the revalidation interval to expire.

### üìå Endpoint
bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/revalidate?secret=YOUR_SECRET
Example (local development):
http://localhost:3000/api/revalidate?secret=testrevalidate

### üîê Authentication
To protect this endpoint, it requires a secret query parameter. Make sure the secret matches the value of REVALIDATE_SECRET in your .env.local file:
```env
REVALIDATE_SECRET=testrevalidate
```
### ‚úÖ Example Request
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/revalidate?secret=testrevalidate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"slug": "my-notion-post"}'
```
### ‚úÖ Success Response
```json
{
  "revalidated": true,
}
```
